1. Subtract the starting value the initial value from all other values
2. Fit function changing scaling factor, and initial time

Feb 26, 2014
1. Finish fit function
2. Produce histograms of total charge (using sum method) for normal shaping Time
3. Produce histogram of total charge (using difference between say 4th entry and 1st entry) for shaping time around 100 ns

Feb 28, 2014
1. Compute integral 
2. Produce histogram using fit function

Mar 11, 2014
Produced plot of qIntegralReadoutValue (it's essentially the scaling factor)
1. Relatively normal distribution
2. RMS / Mean ~ 0.0053

1. Working on PPT
2. Looking for reason why 20 ns shaping time distribution using integral method has such weird distribution. Possible reason: starting time of 10 - 30 ns has first nontrivial point at peak. In other words, the data points contain no information about rise of function to peak. This lack of information may cause smaller scaling factor. Refer to testing.C

1. Need to add

April 2, 2014
1. Need to produce plots of each element of table of powerpoint
2. Need to add Chi Square to display of fit function.
3. Maybe improve fit function by making it the superposition of fit functions
