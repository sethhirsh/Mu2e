1. Subtract the starting value the initial value from all other values
2. Fit function changing scaling factor, and initial time

1. Finish fit function
2. Produce histograms of total charge (using sum method) for normal shaping Time
3. Produce histogram of total charge (using difference between say 4th entry and 1st entry) for shaping time around 100 ns

1. Compute integral 
2. Produce histogram using fit function

Produced plot of qIntegralReadoutValue (it's essentially the scaling factor)
1. Relatively normal distribution
2. RMS / Mean ~ 0.0053

1. Working on PPT
2. Looking for reason why 20 ns shaping time distribution using integral method has such weird distribution. Possible reason: starting time of 10 - 30 ns has first nontrivial point at peak. In other words, the data points contain no information about rise of function to peak. This lack of information may cause smaller scaling factor. Refer to testing.C
